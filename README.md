# Yahtzee
I really like playing Yahtzee on my phone when I have a minute. This SwiftUI (and SceneKit!) app is a simple Yahtzee game. 

You play against a "bot" opponent. There are three different bots, with different skill levels, available to play against.

This is a work-in-progress. It's pretty "bare-bones" right now.
